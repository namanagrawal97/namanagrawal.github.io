- I developed [modules]('https://github.com/namanagrawal97/bionb2220/blob/main/Untitled2.ipynb') to teach basics of AI and ML to undergraduate students without needing any coding experience

- I lead weekly discussion sections consisting of 30 students

- I developed a [website]('https://namanagrawalneuro.notion.site/BIONB2220-Discussion-Sections-efe486ac9f8745fda5a7e63532b27ff0?pvs=74') for students to find the discussion resources after they have graduated.

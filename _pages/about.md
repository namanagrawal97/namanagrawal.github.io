I am a 3rd Year PhD student in Department of Neurobiology and Behavior. I am passionate about Computational Analysis of Behavior, using CV, Tracking algorithms and behavior identification and segmentation. I want to study behavior through an algorithmic perspective, and understand if there are general principles of behavior across species. I am also interested in the neural basis underlying behavior, with special interest in ensemble activity of the neurons generating the behavior.
